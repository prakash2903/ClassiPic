## CNN Architecture:

* Designed using the TensorFlow and Keras framework.

* The model comprises
  - Convolutional layers with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation
  - Max-pooling layers for downsampling
  - Flattening layer
  - Dense layers.

* The output layer uses "softmax activation" for multi-class classification.

## Graphical User Interface (GUI):

* Developed using the " **TaiPy** " library, allowing users to interact with the image classifier.
  
* Provides an *image selector*, *prediction display*, and an *indicator* for the predicted class probability.

* Users can visualize the model's predictions in real-time by selecting an image through the GUI.
